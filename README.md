Jet Framework
====

Paying Homage
----

This project was originally developed by Cory Simmons as the Jeet framework. I have modified his work and stripped a few things out to streamline things even further to my liking. Jet uses stylus as the css preprocessor rather than using a mix of both compass and stylus like Jeet.

###Original Jeet project:
